# Warm welcome to all the muggles interested in learning some visualisations of the real magic! :sparkles:

This is the repository of my own tutorial, which teaches some less known types of plots you can use in R to visualise your results. It contains all the necessary files to complete the tutorial. The tutorial is aimed at people who have some basic experience with R.

In this repository you can also find a folder with the outputs I generated in Rstudio and the dataset I used.
